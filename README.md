   **Bank Customer Churn Analysis Project**
  
**Project Overview**

The Bank Customer Churn Analysis project focuses on understanding and predicting customer churn in a banking context. Churn refers to customers leaving the bank, and reducing churn is critical for maintaining profitability and growth. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze customer data, identify key drivers of churn, and develop predictive models.

**Objectives**

•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data structure and distributions.
•	Identify features most correlated with customer churn.
•	Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn.
•	Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, relationships, and churn trends.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming features to optimize model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluating classifiers such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model performance.

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction]
The dataset contains the following features:
● customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer
● credit_score: Customer's credit score
● country: Customer's country of residence
● gender: Customer's gender
● age: Customer's age
● tenure: Number of years as a customer
● balance: Account balance
● products_number: Number of bank products used
● credit_card: Whether the customer has a credit card
● active_member: Whether the customer is active
● estimated_salary: Estimated salary of the customer
● churn: Whether the customer left the bank (1) or not (0)
